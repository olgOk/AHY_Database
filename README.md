# FileMaker Application: Alliance for Homeless Youth (AHY)

AHY (Alliance for Homeless Youth) offers direct services to homeless youth in the Anytown area
via a networked collection of programs, including an emergency shelter, a drop-in SafePlace center,
training programs, outreach, and more. AHY’s programs stabilize homeless teens’ lives,
meeting their immediate needs and providing a safe, supportive environment and a path to self-sufficiency.

AHY FileMaker app aims to help out at digitizing the most critical data collected about each client,
with the goals of supporting searchability, of enabling visibility of change over time
for the individual client, and of enabling visibility into data aggregated AHY-wide by certain
demographic variables (race, gender, LGBT status, age, etc). This critical data is in the intake
and exit interview forms, and the Life Skills Assessments. Life Skills Assessments are done with clients
during intake, every 3 months while in the program, and at exit.
Currently these forms are completed on paper, then transcribed into spreadsheets (one per youth),
and also transcribed into online systems such as government-mandated central databases.
A FileMaker database holding this data would revolutionize AHY's ability to quickly evaluate change
over time in order to make more informed decisions about clients, programming, and individual/group trends.
